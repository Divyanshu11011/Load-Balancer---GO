# Reverse Proxy Traffic Manager

This Go program implements a reverse proxy traffic manager that distributes incoming HTTP requests among multiple endpoints using a round-robin method.

## Overview

The program consists of the following main components:

- `Endpoint`: An interface defining methods to get the URI of the endpoint, check if it's available, and handle incoming HTTP requests.
- `basicEndpoint`: A basic implementation of the `Endpoint` interface that proxies requests to a single target URI.
- `TrafficManager`: A manager responsible for selecting the next available endpoint and routing incoming requests to it.
- `main`: The entry point of the program where endpoints are defined, and the HTTP server is set up to handle incoming requests.

## Usage

To use the reverse proxy traffic manager:

1. Define the endpoints you want to proxy requests to using the `newBasicEndpoint` function.
2. Create a `TrafficManager` instance with the listening port and the list of endpoints.
3. Set up the HTTP handler for proxy requests using the `proxyRequest` function.
4. Start the HTTP server to listen for incoming requests.

## Dependencies

The program uses the following standard Go packages:

- `fmt`: For formatted I/O.
- `net/http`: For HTTP client and server implementation.
- `net/http/httputil`: For reverse proxy functionality.
- `net/url`: For URL parsing.
- `os`: For handling errors and exiting the program.

## Error Handling

The program includes a basic error handling function `handleError` that logs errors and exits the program. In a real-world scenario, a more robust error handling mechanism should be implemented.

## Notes

- This implementation uses a simple round-robin method to select the next available endpoint. For more complex load balancing strategies, consider using a dedicated load balancer.
- Ensure that the endpoints are responsive and properly configured to handle incoming requests.
- This program is provided as a demonstration and may require modifications for use in production environments.
